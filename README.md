If you have completed the activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are some ways that Chrome DevTools can demystify the CSS that powers the grid? 
Chrome DevTools offers several features to help you understand and debug CSS Grid:

1. **Inspect Grid Elements**: Right-click an element and select "Inspect" to view its HTML and CSS.
2. **CSS Grid Overlay**: Click the grid badge next to the grid container's CSS in the Styles pane to see an overlay of grid lines, tracks, and areas.
3. **Grid Inspector**: Use the Layout pane in the Elements panel to view grid details, such as rows, columns, and gaps.
4. **View Grid Areas and Line Names**: The overlay can display named grid areas and lines.
5. **Track Sizes and Gaps**: View the sizes of rows, columns, and gaps within the grid.
6. **Grid Item Highlighting**: Hover over grid items to see their position and span within the grid.
7. **Computed Styles**: Check the Computed pane for a summary of all CSS properties applied to an element.
8. **Real-Time Changes**: Modify CSS rules directly in the Styles pane to see instant updates.
9. **CSS Grid Cheat Sheet**: Access a quick reference for grid-related properties in the Styles pane.

These tools help visualize and manipulate CSS Grid layouts, making it easier to understand and debug them.
